# Crystal-Reports
 This was a course on SAP's [ Crystal Reports ](http://www.crystalreports.com/). The class was offered by the online [Ed2Go ](http://www.ed2go.com/) system for online courses. I got a good amount out of it. The courses are really quite thorough and written well. 

 It touches a bunch of Crystal Reports report types and topics, and, from that, I was able to make reports that showed off each of the features of crystal reports that I generated.

 These include things such as crosstabs, custom functions, filters, grouping, charts, subreports and maps. 

 An examples of a report I generated can be seen linked below. You can view these using SAP's free [ Crystal Reports Viewer ](http://www.sap.com/solutions/sme/business-intelligence-crystal-solutions/sap-crystal-reports-viewer/index.epx) software.
